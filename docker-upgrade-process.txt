# Setting up cloud machine

1. Start with fresh NubesVMS cloud machine
2. Copy over files:
    a. database dump
    b. infra_setup.sh
    c. docker-compose.yaml (not necessary once new docker-file pushed to infra repo)
    d. db_info.env
3. Unzip database file and rename as infraportal.sql - leave in same dir as infra_setup.sh
4. Run infra_setup.sh (requires elevated privilege)
5. run `drush cr` from the infraportal folder after waiting a few mins for the db to import

N.B on the prod branch, the .htaccess folder needs to be edited to stop redirecting to infraportal.org
    Copy over .htaccess from existing prod/beta servers?


# Update Drupal to v9

#Before starting put the site into maintenance mode
drush state:set system.maintenance_mode 1 --input-format=integer
drush cache:rebuild

1. `drush updb`  # Applies any waiting db updates
    # May need to run it twice if memory error pops up
2. remove wikimedia/composer-merge-plugin
    # remove following lines from composer.json:
    # the "core/composer.json" line must be removed before any composer commands can be used
            "include": [
        ---     "core/composer.json"
            "scripts": [
        ---     "post-package-install": "Drupal\\Core\\Composer\\Composer::vendorTestCodeCleanup",
        ---     "post-package-update": "Drupal\\Core\\Composer\\Composer::vendorTestCodeCleanup"
    a. `composer self-update --1`
    b. `composer remove wikimedia/composer-merge-plugin`
    c. `composer self-update --2`
        
    #MEMORY LIMIT ISSUES
    inside drupal container run
    echo 'memory_limit=128M' >> /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-memlimit.ini

3. `composer require drupal/core 8.9.20 -W`
    a. This is the last version on D8 so get everything working on this before move to 9
4. Move modules to be on D9 supported versions
